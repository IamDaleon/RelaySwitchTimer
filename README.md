# RelaySwitchTimer

This little device allows you to set a time ⏲ to when to turn on and off the device, that it is connected too. Leaving a light on constantly on is a huge waste of electricity 🔌, so let add a microcontroller to make it a little pockect saver on our pockets.

## Before getting started
